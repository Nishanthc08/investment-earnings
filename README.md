# investment-earnings


The provided Java program is a simple investment earnings calculator. It prompts the user to enter the buying price per share and then allows the user to input the closing price for each day of investment. Based on these inputs, it calculates and displays the earnings or losses per share for each day. The user can continue entering closing prices for multiple days until they enter a negative value to exit.
Concepts Covered:

    1. User Input: Using the Scanner class to read input from the user.
    2. Looping: Employing a while loop for continuous input of closing prices until the user decides to exit.
    3. Conditional Statements: Using if-else statements to determine earnings or losses per share based on the comparison of closing price and buying price.
    4. Decimal Formatting: Utilizing DecimalFormat to format the earnings per share to two decimal places.
    5. Basic Arithmetic: Performing simple arithmetic operations such as subtraction to calculate earnings or losses per share.
    6. Break Statement: Using the break statement to exit the loop when the user enters a negative value.
    7. Resource Management: Properly closing the Scanner object using the close() method to prevent resource leaks.

By working on this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with Java fundamentals such as user input, looping, conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and resource management.
